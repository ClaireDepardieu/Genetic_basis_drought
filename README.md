Raw data files
(1) The file GCAT_PG-RNA-3.9.18.fa is a fasta file including all transcripts assembled by P. Rigault from 2x250bp PE Illumina sequencing of a variety of tissues (embryos, needles, phelloderm, megagametophyte... ). The transcriptome was obtained using Gydle (R) Tools.
(2)The file genotype_Depardieu_2020 is a text file containing genotypes of 1,473 trees and 6,153 SNPs. Genotypes are coded as follow: 0 when the individual is homozygous for the first allele, 1 when the individual is heterozygous and 2 when the individual is homozygous for the second allele.
